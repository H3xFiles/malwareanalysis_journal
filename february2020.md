# My route to SecDevOps
I did not use git too much lately **sad_face**, because I do my writings on overleaf, but ...
I rejoy to be here again in 2020 adding some new material to this ongoing [blog](https://github.com/H3xFiles/malwareanalysis_journal/blob/master/july.md) about my own research on malware analysis. ps: this blog may contain other random security topics.

## Security
### Cuckoo 
Cuckoo sandbox has been a little side project that I haven't been able to fully master so far. I hope that with the new things I have learned I will be able to finally have a portable handy and ready to use sandbox for my everyday use. 

### Ghidra
Currently working on some side project

### Metasploit and tenable automation
During my last internship, I had finally had the chance to automate Metasploit, although I am happy about the things I have learned, I fill that I am rather writing a new Metasploit like framework from the ground up.

### Packer vs Vagrant Packer creare the image Vagrant install the software. 
In the beginning is chaos, You can use packer alone, or vagrant alone, but they work better together. But what exactly they do? Because from a first look they seems almost doing the same thing, so, for what you [need them both](https://wyssmann.com/vargante-vs-packer/), [Terminology](https://wyssmann.com/vargante-vs-packer/)
Let's start with some terminology:
 -**Packer** **creates identical machine images** for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer automates the creation of any type of machine image.
-  **Vagrant** does [provisioning](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/). In general **provisioning**, means "providing" or making something available. Provisioners in Vagrant allow you to **automatically install software** using The Vagrant Shell provisioner allows you to upload and execute a script within the guest machine or alter configurations, and more on the machine as part of the vagrant up process.  Vagrant has basically two ways of accessing the virtual machine: SSH and WinRM.
- **Packer** and **Vagrant** are primarily classified as **Packer "Infrastructure Build"** and **Vagrant "Virtual Machine Management"** tools respectively. Provisioning refers to installation and configuration activities (e.g. package installation, user creation, system patching etc. ) performed on a running machine. Packer itself doesn't do any provisioning by itself. **Packer** has other methods of provisioning, but in contrary to Packer,Vagrant provisioning can happen at different moments.
- **Vagrant** does not provide an automatic way to create base images from scratch (iso) so as recommended by Hashicorp you shall use Packer
-  **Packer**, use a JSON file that tells Packer which steps it needs to take to create our base-box.
``` json
"builders": [  
     {  
          "type": "virtualbox-iso",  
          "boot_command": [  
               "<tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/ks.cfg<enter><wait>"

          "iso_checksum_type": "sha256",  
          "ssh_username": "tutorial",  
          "ssh_password": "P@ssw0rd",  
          "ssh_wait_timeout": "9000s",  
          "ssh_port": 22,  
          "shutdown_command": "echo 'tutorial' | sudo -S shutdown -P now",  
          "guest_additions_path": "VBoxGuestAdditions_{{.Version}}.iso",  
          "virtualbox_version_file": ".vbox_version",  
          "vboxmanage": [  
               [ "modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--memory", "2048" ],  
               [ "modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--cpus", "1" ]  
          ]  
     }
]
```
- Vagrant, now that we’re done with creating a base box we can start to provision it with Vagrant. [link](https://www.rubix.nl/blogs/utilizing-vagrant-and-packer-for-provisioning-development-environments/)
